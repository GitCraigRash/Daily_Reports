A sub-σ-algebra is a subset of a σ-algebra that itself satisfies the properties of a σ-algebra. That is, it is closed under complementation
and countable unions, and it includes the empty set and the full set Ω.

A filtration is a mathematical way to model the accumulation of information over time.

Finsihed reading the paper after asking Chat about almost every step. 
It seem sto culimnate by saying that the possiblity of A(an event) given G (G being a subset 
of all possiblites (F)), is the same as integering(not summing) every possibility(each possiblity is 
labeled ω) in G multiplied by the probability of A given G multiplied by the differential of the probability of ω(in F???)
dP(ω)
The formula -
\int_{G} P(A|G)(ω) dP(ω) = P(A ∩ G)

1:21pm - Identifying Factors Contributing to "Bad Days" for Software Developers: a Mixed Methods Study

it seems that the top qualifiers for a "bad day" were Engineering System Friction, Blocked or Stuck, and Poor Productivity.
The top causes of "bad days" were PR delayed due to reason beyond their control, 
They felt like they got nothing done, Lapetop was slow/laggy, hard time finding support,
More than half the day was filled with meetings, people and teamates close to you affectd by events like layoffs and more.
