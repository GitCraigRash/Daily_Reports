Can A+A and AA = {ab , a,b\in A} boht be small for the same A?

Erdo' mulitpication table problem
  is a classic problem in number theory related to counting distinct 
  products in a multiplication table. 

I am confused how the values on the table change over the table because it seems to say the table is the results of two numbers x and y. But how can there be a table if x and y only can have one result?

Turns out, it seems to multiply by this table:
1 * 1 ; 1 * 2 ; 1 * 3 ;
2 * 1 ; 2 * 2 ; 2 * 3 ;
3 * 1 ; 3 * 2 ; 3 * 3 ;
And is asking "how  many unique products are there?" Answer: {1,2,3,4,6,9}

There were other theroms, but I could not follow exactly what why Geon shared this with me 
or why it is relevant.

I learned - 
1. Binomial Distribution
Type: Discrete distribution.
Number of Trials: Fixed number of trials (n).
Outcomes: Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).
Probability: Probability of success (p) is constant across trials.
Independence: Trials are independent of one another.

2. Normal Distribution
Type: Continuous distribution.
Shape: Bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.
Parameters: Defined by two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
Range: Values can range from −∞ to +∞.

3. Poisson Distribution
Type: Discrete distribution.
Occurrences: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval (time, area, volume) given a constant average rate (λ).
Independence: Events occur independently of one another

Convergence in probability theory refers to the idea of a sequence of random variables 
approaching a specific value or distribution as the number of trials or observations increases.

I learned - 
Normalization: The probability of the entire sample space Ω is 1:
Non-negativity: For any eventA∈F, 𝑃(𝐴)≥0
Countable Additivity (or σ-additivity): For any countable collection of disjoint 
sets {𝐴_𝑖}_(𝑖∈𝐼) where {A_i \cup A_j = ∅ for i \neq j) in F:
P(\bigcup{i∈I} Ai!) = \sum{ i ∈ I} P(A_i)
This property essentially states that if we have a collection of mutually exclusive
(disjoint) events, then the probability of at least one of these events occurring is
the sum of their individual probabilities.
